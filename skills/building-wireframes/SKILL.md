# Wireframe Builder

Generate lo-fi wireframes as single HTML files using Tailwind CSS with a grayscale `wire-*` palette.

## Philosophy: You Are an Artist

You are not an assembler copying pre-made blocks. You are a designer creating unique visual compositions.

Each wireframe is a blank canvas. The user's request is your inspiration, not a specification to match mechanically. Your goal is to craft something that *feels right* for the specific problem — not to follow a template.

**Core beliefs:**
- There is no "correct" page structure — only what serves the user's intent
- Every wireframe should be unique, even for similar requests
- Whitespace is a powerful design tool, not empty space to fill
- Asymmetry can be more interesting than perfect grids
- Unconventional layouts are welcome when they serve clarity
- Less is often more — restraint creates focus

## Creative Process

1. **Understand the essence** — What is the user really trying to communicate?
2. **Visualize freely** — Imagine the page as a composition, not a list of components
3. **Experiment with layout** — Try unusual arrangements, unexpected proportions
4. **Apply the wire-* palette** — Work within the grayscale constraint
5. **Create something unique** — The result should feel crafted, not assembled

## Technical Foundation

### HTML Template

Start with `assets/template.html` — it provides:
- Tailwind CSS with `wire-*` color tokens
- Alpine.js for interactivity when needed
- Base styles and responsive meta tags

**Note:** Keep only the `<head>` section and start with an empty `<body>`. The demo content in template.html is just an example of the wire-* palette in action.

### Design Tokens

See [components.md](references/components.md) for the full `wire-*` color palette.

### Interactivity

- **CSS-only (preferred)**: hover, focus, transitions, `<details>` accordion
- **Alpine.js**: modals, dropdowns, tabs → See [interactive.md](references/interactive.md)

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first: start with single column
- Use `md:` breakpoint for tablet/desktop
- Grid: `grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Hide on mobile: `hidden md:flex`
- Show on mobile: `md:hidden`

## Creative Freedom

**Encouraged:**
- Unusual grid proportions (70/30, 40/60, single wide column)
- Generous whitespace and breathing room
- Asymmetric layouts when they create visual interest
- Breaking conventional section order
- Minimalist approaches — only what's essential
- Creative use of borders, spacing, and visual rhythm
- Typography hierarchy as the primary visual tool

**Remember:**
- References in `references/` are optional inspiration, not required components
- You can invent new patterns that don't exist in the references
- Modify any pattern freely — they're starting points, not constraints
- The best wireframe is one that solves the specific problem elegantly

## Reference Library

| Category | File | Contains |
|----------|------|----------|
| Tokens | [components.md](references/components.md) | Design tokens, color palette, overview |
| Layout | [navigation.md](references/navigation.md) | Header, sidebar, footer, breadcrumbs |
| Content | [content.md](references/content.md) | Hero, cards, testimonials, pricing |
| Forms | [forms.md](references/forms.md) | Inputs, buttons, complete forms |
| Data | [tables.md](references/tables.md) | Tables, pagination |
| Interactive | [interactive.md](references/interactive.md) | Modal, dropdown, tabs (Alpine.js) |
| Mobile | [mobile.md](references/mobile.md) | Bottom nav, mobile cards |
| States | [states.md](references/states.md) | Loading, empty, progress |

Use as inspiration. Modify freely or create new patterns.

## Context Analysis

### Understanding the Request
- Read user's prompt or document completely
- Extract the *intent*, not just the literal requirements
- Identify the emotional tone: professional, playful, minimal, rich?
- Consider the target audience

### Minimal Questions
Only ask when genuinely ambiguous:
- "Should I include [element] mentioned in the doc?"
- "The document describes two flows. Which is primary?"

Never ask about categories, styles, or structural choices — make creative decisions.

## File Naming & Storage

### Output Directory
All wireframes save to `wireframes/` in project root.

### Naming Convention
Generate kebab-case names from content (2-4 words):
- User profile page → `user-profile.html`
- Product checkout → `checkout-flow.html`
- Admin user list → `admin-users.html`

### Confirmation Flow
Suggest a name before saving:
> "I'll save this as `wireframes/user-profile.html`. Is this name okay?"

## Example

**User request:** "Create a simple landing page for a productivity app"

**Claude creates:** `wireframes/productivity-landing.html` with:
- Sticky header with logo and CTA
- Hero section with headline and app screenshot placeholder
- 3-column features grid
- Testimonial card
- CTA section
- Simple footer
